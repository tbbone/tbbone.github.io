&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-blockchain-brokerage-s-ceo-co-founder-nathan-sharp-shares-his-thoughts-on-london-s-january-2017-blockchain-week&#34;&gt;The Blockchain Brokerage&amp;rsquo;s CEO &amp;amp; Co-founder, Nathan Sharp, shares his thoughts on London&amp;rsquo;s January 2017 Blockchain Week&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been the most exciting journey of my life. To give a brief summary of what occurred, my business partner, Biswa, and I had purchased tickets to the London Blockchain Expo. I flew out there with the intent to learn and raise awareness for our startup The Blockchain Brokerage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part of the expo for me was not necessarily making connections, although I did end up leaving with quite a few of those, it was the people I got to see speak on stage. I saw Sasha Ivanov of Wavesplatform, Bobby Lee of BTCC, developers from Ethereum, and the most exciting, people coming to speak about USE CASE for Blockchain technology. I personally feel that the space is saturated with Blockchains and do not necessarily need more so much as we need utilization of this technology in our every-day lives. I feel that utilization and an eco-system of applications is what will cause the realization in price for crypto-graphics currencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the highlights of my trip was seeing a man named Jack Shaw speak on stage about smart contracts:
He proposed a system that would essentially sit in the computers of airplanes. As the individual pieces would give feedback on their health it would determine whether or not it would need to execute a repair contract. If the case was yes, essentially what would happen is the smart contract would systematically contact the supplier, relay location of next landing destination, and then order a blue-print of the part, which would then be sent to a 3D-printer, and delivered from the closest airplane part warehouse, and be there 30 minutes before the plane even lands, with staff on the ready to jump in to replace the part.
When he said this I felt absolutely enlightened.  Why? Because I felt that my approach with TBB was not only fully valid, but a logical move, everyone is working on making new Blockchains, I want to utilize what is already out there to create services, and from there help to build the infrastructure for tomorrow’s financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other highlight of my trip was getting to socialize with all of these people to whom I have been looking up. I attended the Wavesplatform meet at Revolution Bar after the expo and got to meet the team, Sasha, and some other startups that were looking into places like Papua, New Guinea. We talked about the vision we saw for crypto moving forward, it was a beautiful vision. In fact, many of the people I spoke with were not too foreign to the idea of maybe working together on a project down the line. To me, teamwork is the force that will allow this movement to gain some real traction, strength in numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also proud to announce that The Blockchain Brokerage’s first venture will be an Indian Bitcoin exchange named Bharat Pay, slated to launch before the end of Q2 this year, and there are many more exciting things to come following this, stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
